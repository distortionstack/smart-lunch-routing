# Backend — Smart Lunch Routing

Express + TypeScript + TiDB Cloud MySQL-compatible API using
**MVC + Service Layer + Domain Layer**.

## Architecture

```
Client (Angular)
  ↓
Routes        HTTP endpoint definitions (`src/routes/`)
  ↓
Controllers   HTTP request/response handling (`src/controllers/`)
  ↓
Services      application/system workflows (`src/services/`)
  ↓
Domain        business rules & algorithms (`src/domain/`)
  ↓           (only when business rules are needed; plain CRUD skips Domain)
Models        database access / persistence (`src/models/`)
  ↓
MySQL pool    connection config (`src/database/`)
  ↓
TiDB Cloud    credentials via environment variables, never in source
```

- **MVC** organizes HTTP/data flow (routes → controllers → models).
- **Service layer** holds application workflows (controller → service → model).
- **Domain layer** holds business rules and routing algorithms
  (`domain/delivery/`, `domain/routing/`).
- **TiDB Cloud** is the runtime MySQL-compatible database; all connection values come from environment variables.

Example CRUD flow (no Domain needed):

```
POST /api/customers → CustomerController → CustomerService → CustomerModel → TiDB
```

Example planning flow (Domain involved):

```
POST /api/route-plans/generate → RoutePlanController → RoutePlanningService
  → OsrmTableProvider (or Haversine fallback) → cluster → sequence
  → deadline gate → cost → RoutePlanModel → TiDB
```

## Structure

The backend follows the controller/data-access separation taught in the
NodeJS Web API (TS) vault, with service and domain layers retained for
non-trivial business rules:

## Run locally

Frontend (repo root, unchanged):

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd start
```

Backend (the health endpoint works without a database; DB routes return 503 until env is set):

```powershell
cd BackEnd\smart-lunch-routing-backend
npm.cmd install
copy .env.example .env
npm.cmd run dev
```

Other backend commands:

```powershell
npm.cmd test
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd run start
```

Live OSRM verification (opt-in, real network, never part of `npm test`):

```powershell
npm.cmd run verify:live-osrm
```

Health check: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/health`

## Endpoints

- `GET/POST /api/customers`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/customers/:id`
- `GET /api/customers?search=สมชาย` searches any part of the stored name
- `GET /api/customers/nearby?lat=&lng=&radiusKm=` (`radiusKm` defaults to 1)
- `GET/POST /api/orders` (`?status=&date=&customerId=` supported), `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/orders/:id`
- `GET /api/orders/nearby?lat=&lng=&radiusKm=` (`radiusKm` defaults to 2)
- `POST /api/orders/simulate` with optional `{ "count": 25, "orderDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`
- `DELETE /api/orders/simulated` deletes only rows created by the simulation endpoint
- `GET/POST /api/riders` (`?available=true` supported), `GET/PUT /api/riders/:id`
- `POST /api/route-plans/generate` `{planDate}` → 201 RoutePlan (new plan each call)
- `POST /api/route-plans/recalculate` `{planDate}` → 201 deterministic alternative plan
- `GET /api/route-plans?date=` → plan summaries
- `GET /api/route-plans/:id` → full plan with jobs, stops, geometry
- `POST /api/route-plans/:id/select` → SELECTED + orders move PENDING → PLANNED
- `POST /api/auth/login` creates an owner or rider session; `GET /api/auth/me` checks it; `POST /api/auth/logout` revokes it.
- `PUT /api/auth/password` lets a signed-in rider change their own password.
- `GET /api/my-jobs?date=YYYY-MM-DD` returns only the signed-in rider's selected jobs.
- `POST /api/my-jobs/:jobId/stops/:orderId/deliver` checks rider ownership inside the delivery transaction.
- `PUT /api/riders/:id/password` lets an owner set or reset a rider password.
- `PUT /api/riders/:id/account` lets an owner set a unique rider username and optional new password; it revokes existing sessions.

Without DB credentials, DB-backed routes answer 503; bad `planDate` answers
400; infeasible/no-order generations answer 422. Docs: `docs/distance-domain.md`,
`docs/routing-pipeline.md`.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then fill in local values. Do not commit `.env`.

Required TiDB Cloud runtime variables:

```env
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=4000
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=smart_lunch_route
DB_SSL=true
DB_SSL_CA_PATH=./certs/isrgrootx1.pem
```

Use the application database user for runtime. Do not use TiDB root/admin as
`DB_USER` in `.env`. The CA file should be the TiDB Cloud CA certificate; see
[certs/README.md](certs/README.md).

## Database setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in the database values, then apply the
migrations in order. Migration 003 marks generated orders so the clear
endpoint cannot delete real orders. `database/schema.sql` is a reference
schema for a fresh database; do not run it together with migrations 001–003,
because it already contains `orders.is_simulated`.

```powershell
npm.cmd run db:migrate
npm.cmd run db:migrate:routing
npm.cmd run db:migrate:simulation
npm.cmd run db:migrate:cost-formula
npx.cmd tsx scripts/run-sql.ts database/migrations/005_order_route_geometry.sql
npm.cmd run db:init-settings
```

To remove the unused nullable timestamps from an existing database, run
`npm.cmd run db:migrate:remove-unused-columns`. The migration checks that each
target column contains only `NULL` values before dropping it and skips columns
that are already absent.

Apply the account migration once before deploying the login UI. It checks existing columns, so it also works on databases that already have `admin_users` and `riders.password_hash`:

```powershell
npm.cmd run db:migrate:accounts
npm.cmd run db:create-owner
```

`db:create-owner` prompts for the username and password without echoing either value. It refuses to overwrite an existing owner. Passwords are bcrypt hashes at cost 10; plaintext passwords are not written to the repository. The account migration gives existing riders a unique `rider_<id>` username. The owner can change it from the rider management page and set a rider's initial password there; riders can change their own password after login. Numeric rider IDs remain accepted during the UI rollout. Account or password changes revoke existing rider sessions.

All customer, order, route-plan, rider-management and settings endpoints require an owner session. Rider job endpoints require a rider session. Sessions expire after 12 hours. Deploy backend and frontend together after running the migration; an old frontend cannot call the newly protected API.

`npm.cmd run db:prune-drafts` previews generated/rejected plans older than 30 days. `npm.cmd run db:prune-drafts -- --apply` deletes only those drafts. Selected plans are excluded, and plans with completed deliveries cannot be deleted through the API. Delivery records are stored in `delivery_jobs` and `delivery_job_orders`.

`CORS_ORIGIN` accepts a comma-separated allowlist. If the database provider
requires a CA certificate, use `DB_SSL_CA` for Vercel (PEM text, optionally
with `\\n`) or `DB_SSL_CA_PATH` for a local certificate file.

## Deploy to Vercel

### Review fixes: database migration

The revised backend requires `route_plans.input_snapshot`. Before starting it
against an existing database, back up the database, pause application writes,
verify the target `DB_*` environment, and run the earlier migrations above first:

```powershell
npm.cmd run db:migrate:review
```

This command adds plan input snapshots, unique customer/rider phone constraints,
and prevents deleting riders referenced by jobs. Duplicate phone numbers stop
the command before schema changes; resolve duplicates explicitly without losing
customer history. DDL is not atomic: if a later step fails, fix the cause and
rerun the command, which checks existing columns, indexes, and constraints.

The foreign key step requires `REFERENCES` permission on `riders`. If that step
is denied, snapshots and draft invalidation have already committed; the command
still fails to flag the incomplete constraint. Grant the required permission
and rerun the same command to finish it.

Legacy selected plans receive a baseline of currently stored customer and shop
data. Original historical inputs cannot be reconstructed; this baseline does
not prove that old geometry matches those inputs. Legacy generated drafts are
rejected and must be recalculated. New plans retain their original inputs and
are checked again before selection. Unit tests mock the database; this migration
still needs verification against a disposable MySQL/TiDB database before production.

No custom `vercel.json` is needed. `src/app.ts` exports the Express app as the
default export for Vercel, while `src/server.ts` remains the local port
listener.

When importing the repository in Vercel:

1. Set **Root Directory** to `BackEnd/smart-lunch-routing-backend`.
2. Leave Framework Preset, Build Command, and Output Directory on automatic
   detection. Node.js 20+ is declared in `package.json`.
3. Add all `DB_*` values and `CORS_ORIGIN` to Production and Preview as needed.
4. Apply migrations from a trusted local/admin environment before sending
   traffic to the deployment. Do not run migrations inside an API request.
5. Verify `GET /api/health`, then log in and call a DB-backed endpoint with the returned bearer token.

For CLI deployment, run from this backend directory after signing in:

```powershell
npx.cmd vercel
npx.cmd vercel --prod
```

## Authoritative business rules

### Dispatch rounds and rider acknowledgment

- Generate accepts optional `startTime`, `deadline`, and a nonempty `orderIds` list of pending orders for that date. Omit `orderIds` to plan all pending orders. Orders outside an explicit batch remain pending for another round.
- Available riders must be active, manually ready, have login credentials, and have no pending delivery in a selected plan. Assignment preference is today's assigned order count, then last assignment time, then rider ID. It does not guarantee equal distance or earnings.
- Selecting a draft accepts an optional complete `assignments: [{jobId, riderId}]` mapping. Repeated riders, foreign jobs, changed inputs, or newly busy riders are rejected. The shop transaction lock serializes confirmation; disjoint rounds can coexist on the same date.
- Rider endpoints `POST /api/my-jobs/:jobId/acknowledge` and `/start` require the assigned rider's identity. Acknowledgment is required before starting or recording delivery. Completed jobs cannot restart.
- `stopServiceMinutes` is an integer from 0 to 30, default 0. Each stop's service time contributes to route duration, subsequent ETA, and deadline feasibility. Round windows and original shop settings are preserved in the input snapshot.

For an existing database, finish the account and review migrations first, then run from this directory against the intended database:

```powershell
npm.cmd run db:migrate:dispatch
```

This idempotent migration adds `delivery_jobs.acknowledged_at`, `delivery_jobs.assigned_at`, and `shop_settings.stop_service_minutes`. It rejects old GENERATED drafts without the new timing settings; recalculate them. Selected history is preserved and is not marked acknowledged automatically. Legacy assignment ordering falls back to job creation time because the original assignment time cannot be reconstructed. ALTER TABLE steps are not atomic; fix any reported error and rerun.

Migration tests mock database calls. The dispatch migration has not yet been verified against a real MySQL/TiDB database or applied to production as part of these local changes.

- Order: 1–3 boxes. Rider: at most 3 ORDERS (no box-capacity rule).
- Start 11:30, deadline 12:30, fallback speed 30 km/h (all from `shop_settings`).
- Revenue = boxes × 65, food = boxes × 40, rider delivery per job
  = 15 + 2 × routeKm × boxes in job, profit = revenue − food − delivery.
- Haversine = approximate straight-line fallback; OSRM = preferred road source
  (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap render the map; no Google APIs).

## Reused logic

- Haversine distance ported from `src/app/core/delivery.service.ts`
  (now `R = 6371.0088 km`, validated coordinates).
- Grouping limit of 3 orders/rider preserved as `MAX_ORDERS_PER_RIDER`
  (orders only — no box-capacity rule exists).
- Cost/deadline values sourced from `shop_settings`
  (65/40 THB, 15 + 2×km×boxes, 11:30→12:30, 30 km/h).

## Open TODOs

Legacy migration notes, live OSRM verification (unit tests mock HTTP), richer alternative-plan strategies. See code
`TODO` comments and `docs/routing-pipeline.md`.
